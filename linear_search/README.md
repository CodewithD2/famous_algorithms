# Linear Search

This directory contains implementations of the linear search algorithm.

## Implementations

*   `linear_search.py`: This file contains two implementations of the linear search algorithm:
    1.  `linear_search_simple(arr, target)`: A basic linear search that iterates from the beginning of the list.
    2.  `linear_search_bidirectional(arr, target)`: A linear search that simultaneously searches from both ends of the list.
