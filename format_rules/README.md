# Formatting Rules

This document outlines the formatting rules for this project.

## General Rules

*   Use a consistent coding style.
*   Add comments to your code where necessary.
*   Use clear and concise variable names.
*   **Avoid Duplication:** Do not repeat code or information. If you find yourself writing the same thing in multiple places, consider creating a reusable function, variable, or document.

## Algorithm Contribution Rules

*   **No Duplicate Algorithms:** Before adding a new algorithm, please check the existing list of algorithms to ensure it has not already been implemented. We want to maintain a unique set of algorithms in this repository.

## Markdown Rules

*   Use headings to structure your documents.
*   Use links to reference other documents.
*   Use code blocks to display code snippets.
